## General info  

 A website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. A remake of a previous project written using class components, did this remake to practice using functional components, hooks, testing using jest and enzyme, writing code with accessibility in mind and writing a good README document.
